Three men were killed in a single-car crash early Saturday morning on Highway 24 in Orinda when their red 2009 Nissan Versa slammed into a tree, according to the California Highway Patrol.

Officers arrived to the scene at about 3:07 a.m. and pronounced the three men dead, the agency said on Facebook. The passengers were a 31-year-old from Oakland and a 22-year-old from Hayward. The driver has not yet been identified.

The Nissan Versa was heading west on Highway 24 when it veered off into a tree-covered hillside north of the highway, according to the agency. The car then crashed into a tree, killing the three men inside.

It is not known if drugs or alcohol were involved in the crash, which is under investigation. Anyone with information is asked to call the CHP in Martinez at 925-646-4980.





Two men were killed and three people seriously injured when two cars crashed in the West Midlands.

Police have launched an investigation into the collision, which took place on the A41 Black Country New Road in Wednesbury at about 10.30pm on Friday. The crash, which involved a black Jeep Cherokee and a black VW Golf, happened near the Patent Shaft roundabout.

Despite efforts by the emergency services, two men, aged 21 and 37, were pronounced dead at the scene, while three people sustained serious injuries and remain in hospital.

The victims’ families have been informed and are being supported by officers, West Midlands police said.

The road was closed in both directions between the Patent Shaft roundabout and Moxley Junction for several hours to allow police to examine the scene.

Sgt Alan Hands from the serious collision investigation unit said: “We’re currently working to establish the circumstances surrounding the collision and whether any other vehicles were involved.

“I’d ask that anyone who has information or witnessed what happened, in particular any motorists who were in the area and have dashcam footage to come forward and contact the investigation team.”
